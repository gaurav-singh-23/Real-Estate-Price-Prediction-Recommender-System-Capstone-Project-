# Real Estate Analysis - Notebooks

This repo contains only Jupyter Notebooks in which I did analysis related to real estate of Gurgaon mainly. I used data from [99acres.com](https://99acres.com/) which I scrapped using my [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) web-app. You can see that app's codes in my GitHub repo [here](https://github.com/arv-anshul/99acres.com).

## üí≠ Details on Repo Structure and more...

1. You can see that I did versioning of my notebooks like [notebooks_v1](https://github.com/arv-anshul/campusx-project-notebooks/tree/main/notebooks_v1), [notebooks_v2](https://github.com/arv-anshul/campusx-project-notebooks/tree/main/notebooks_v2) and so on. This means that in every new version of notebooks I upgraded the data which is more suitable for Data Analysis.

2. I also did versioning on Jupyter Notebooks individually which shows that you have to follow that version to get insights respectively.  
   I also follows a naming convention for my notebooks which helps me to identify my notebooks easily. I follow below naming convention:

|                             Name | Description                                              | Exporting |
| -------------------------------: | :------------------------------------------------------- | --------- |
|            **`_OVERVIEW.ipynb`** | Perform a very comprehensive overview of the dataset.    | **False** |
|  **`<ver>_PREPROCESSING.ipynb`** | Perform Preprocessing                                    | **True**  |
|            **`<ver>_EDA.ipynb`** | Perform Exploratory Data Analysis                        | **False** |
|       **`<ver>_FEAT_ENG.ipynb`** | Perform Feature Engineering                              | **True**  |
| **`<ver>_FEAT_SELECTION.ipynb`** | Calculate Feature Importance & Perform Feature Selection | **False** |
